# CS230_Operating_Platforms
This is a portfolio submission for Southern New Hampshire University in class CS230 Operating Platforms.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wanted to develop a web-based game serving multiple platforms based on their current game "Draw It or Lose It", which was at the time only available as an Android app. The Gaming Room wanted to implement simultaneous multiple-team, multiple-player gameplay where all games, teams, and player names were unique and only one game instance was allowed at a time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did particularly well in developing this documentation was consolidating concepts such that the customer could get a clear yet concise picture overall of the implementation and design. The table identifying pros and cons of each operating platform were created with the notion of readability from cell to cell for ease of comparisons.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
What I found helpful when working through the design document was the itemization and identification of key components with the intent of organizational transparency. This opens up the pipeline of communication and allows key components to be laid out on the table such that all parties can collaborate efficiently.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one portion of these documents to revise, it would be to make the UML bigger and easier to read. This may have involved turning it sideways or redesigning the layout of the diagram but it would definitely make it easier to read and interpret for the client.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs as a directive to guide me towards the best solution. Instead of just settling on a couple cheap platforms, I looked at all the popular platforms such as Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Mobile Platforms to contrast and compare. Additionally, since the client had specific requirements of having one allowable game instance at a time, and supporting only unique identifiers for game, teams, and players, I made it a point to utilize object-oriented programming techniques in isolating the game instance and the unique identifiers. It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing software because the client likely knows their customer much better than you and has likely done their own research as to what they want, who they want to target, how they want to target, and at the end of the day, it is their product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software by utilizing UML diagrams and a flowchart. I find that the UML diagram helps to identify relationships of entities, and the flowchart pinpoints directions and flow of components as well as decision-making and other important cross-roads to address. Some techniques or strategies I would use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application would be to adopt agile methodologies such as creating user stories, implementing sprints and feedback loops to the client, and keeping an open line of communication with my development team as well as my client and stakeholders.
